    "description": "My name is Erik, and I’m a game programmer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I began my programming journey with C++, C#, and PHP, and have been deeply involved with Unity, studying it since 2015 and working professionally with the engine since 2016. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on multiplayer games (using Unity’s HLAPI, Mirror HLAPI, and Photon PUN), VR games for Oculus Go, and backend integration with JavaScript, TypeScript, Prisma, GraphQL, AWS Lambda, GameSparks, and Steamworks.NET. I was actively involved in features including UI/UX programming, gameplay development, and tools creation. Academically, I’ve had the chance to explore Unity, Physics, AR with Vuforia OpenGL Phaser with Ionic, Arduino, Unreal Engine 4 and 5, C and 3D math. Some of my recent projects include Relic Hunters: Legend (a multiplayer shooter-looter), Edify Play (a mobile/WebGL educational game), and Remnants of Nightfall (my final college project developed in Unreal Engine 5)."
