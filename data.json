    "description": "My name is Erik, and I’m a game programmer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I began my programming journey with <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>PHP</strong>, and have been deeply involved with <strong>Unity Engine</strong>, studying it since 2015 and working professionally with the engine since 2016. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on multiplayer games (using Unity’s <strong>HLAPI</strong>, <strong>Mirror HLAPI</strong>, and <strong>Photon PUN</strong>), VR games for <strong>Oculus Go</strong>, and integration with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Prisma</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong>GameSparks</strong>, and <strong>Steamworks.NET</strong>. I was actively involved in features including UI/UX programming, gameplay development, and tools creation. Academically, I’ve had the chance to explore <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Data structures</strong>, <strong>Physics</strong>, <strong>AR with Vuforia</strong>, <strong>Phaser with Ionic</strong>, <strong>Arduino</strong>, <strong>Unreal Engine 4 and 5</strong>, <strong>Computer Graphics using OpenGL</strong>, and <strong>3D math</strong>. Some of my recent projects include <strong><a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/633080/Relic_Hunters_Legend/' target='_blank'>Relic Hunters: Legend</a></strong> (a multiplayer shooter-looter), <strong><a href='https://edifyeducation.com.br/edify-play/' target='_blank'>Edify Play</a></strong> (a mobile/WebGL educational game), and <strong><a href='https://utopia-game-studio.itch.io/remnants-of-nightfall' target='_blank'>Remnants of Nightfall</a></strong> (my final college project developed in Unreal Engine 5)."
