                Game Developer | C# | Unity | C++| Unreal | C# Unity Programmer

              <p>
                My name is Erik, and I’m a game programmer based in Porto
                Alegre, Brazil. I began my programming journey with C++, C#, and
                PHP, and have been deeply involved with Unity, studying it since
                2015 and working professionally with the engine since 2016.
                Throughout my career, I’ve worked on multiplayer games (using
                Unity’s HLAPI, Mirror HLAPI, and Photon PUN), VR games for
                Oculus Go, and backend integration with JavaScript, TypeScript,
                Prisma, GraphQL, AWS Lambda, GameSparks, and Steamworks.NET. I
                was actively involved in features including UI/UX programming,
                gameplay development, and tools creation. Academically, I’ve had
                the chance to explore Unity, Physics, AR with Vuforia OpenGL
                Phaser with Ionic, Arduino, Unreal Engine 4 and 5, C and 3D
                math. Some of my recent projects include Relic Hunters:
                Legend (a multiplayer shooter-looter), Edify Play (a
                mobile/WebGL educational game), and Remnants of Nightfall (my
                final college project developed in Unreal Engine 5).
